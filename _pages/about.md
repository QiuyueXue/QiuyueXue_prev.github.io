I'm a 5th-year CSE PhD student at UW [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shwetak Patel](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak) and [Prof. Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/). My main research interests are Ubiquitous Computing, Computing for Health, and novel Sensing Techniques. Specifically, I'm interested in low-power/self-powered wearable devices for health sensing and interaction applications. My most recent work explores turning jewelry (earrings, necklaces, etc.) into smart fashionable wearables for continuous health monitorinig.

Before joining the PhD program at UW, I got my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, where I was working with Prof. Gregory Abowd and Prof. Thad Starner. I got B.S. in Microelectronics and B.S. in Computer Science degrees from Peking University in 2017.
